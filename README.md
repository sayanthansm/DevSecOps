🔐 DevSecOps — Policy-Driven Secret Leak Prevention in CI/CD
📌 Overview

Modern software teams frequently leak secrets (API keys, tokens, credentials) into source code repositories. While CI/CD platforms can report failures, they do not define or enforce security policy.

This project implements a custom, explainable, policy-as-code security gate that detects hardcoded secrets early (“shift-left”), enforces configurable security rules, and guides developers toward secure remediation — all integrated into CI/CD.

🎯 Problem Statement

Developers accidentally commit secrets into repositories.
Existing detection mechanisms often:

Trigger too late

Lack enforcement

Provide poor remediation guidance

Are tightly coupled to specific CI platforms

Goal:
Build a tool-agnostic, policy-driven CI/CD security gate that:

Detects secrets early

Enforces risk-based policies

Provides actionable fixes

Measures security posture over time

🚀 Key Features
✅ Shift-Left Secret Detection

Scans source code before deployment

Works locally and in CI/CD

Supports .py, .js, .env, .csv

✅ Risk-Based Severity Classification

Secrets are classified into:

HIGH – Critical secrets (e.g., AWS Access Keys)

MEDIUM – Generic API keys & tokens

INVALID – Non-secret strings (ignored)

✅ Policy-as-Code Enforcement

Security behavior is not hardcoded.

Defined via scanner/policy.yml:

enforcement:
  block:
    - HIGH
  warn:
    - MEDIUM


This allows:

Flexible enforcement

Environment-specific policies

Behavior changes without code changes

✅ Explainable Security Output

Each finding includes:

Secret type

Severity

File & line number

Clear remediation steps

Example:

❌ AWS Access Key (HIGH)
Location: demo-app/test_keys.csv:2
Fix:
- Remove hardcoded key
- Store in GitHub Secrets
- Access via environment variables

✅ Developer-Friendly (DX-Focused)

PR-friendly output formatting

Clear fix suggestions

No cryptic security messages

✅ Controlled Evaluation via CSV Dataset

Curated dataset with:

High-risk secrets

Medium-risk secrets

Invalid (negative) cases

Ensures reproducible testing

Avoids randomness & false negatives

✅ Metrics & Accuracy Reporting

Provides:

Number of files scanned

Severity counts

Detection accuracy

Ignored entries

✅ Security Regression Detection

Tracks security posture across runs:

⚠ HIGH increased: 2 → 4
⚠ MEDIUM increased: 2 → 4


Helps teams detect worsening security trends, not just single failures.

GitHub Actions acts only as an execution layer.
All security decisions are made by this project’s logic.

🧪 How to Run Locally
1️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install pyyaml

2️⃣ Run scanner
python scanner/secret_scanner.py

3️⃣ Modify policy (optional)

Edit:

scanner/policy.yml


Change enforcement behavior without touching code.

🔁 CI/CD Integration

The scanner runs automatically via GitHub Actions:

Fails pipeline if policy blocks findings

Passes pipeline if policy allows them

GitHub only reports the result — it does not define security logic

🧠 Design Philosophy

Detection ≠ Enforcement

Policy controls behavior

Security must be explainable

Developer experience matters

Metrics prove effectiveness

🔮 Future Enhancements

Organization-wide central policies

Automated secret rotation

PR comment integration

Security scoring dashboards

ML-assisted classification (augmentation only)

🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how DevSecOps principles can be applied to:

Enforce security early

Reduce human error

Maintain flexibility via policy-as-code

Improve developer adoption

It is CI-platform agnostic, extensible, and production-oriented.
